# dataVisualization-covid
The project involves covid-19 datasets in order to plot some graphs with the help of which people might get certain idea about corona death rates, recovery rates, cases recorded in particular months, what all symptoms highly recorded that increase chances of covid and so on. We had used some of the python data visualization libraries like pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, seaborn.

An overview of plots and maps in the project-

• Line plot –
  - dates v/s death, showing deaths in different dates.
  – dates v/s recovery, showing recoveries in different dates.
  – dates v/s cases, showing cases recorded on different dates.
  
• Subplot – 
  - dates v/s cases, deaths, recovery, single graph for three different plots.
  
• Pie plot - 
  - for comparison of death, recovery, active cases, overall cases in percentage.

• Bar plot - 
  - showing symptoms of coronavirus in percentage.
  
• Comparison plots between cases and recovery rate, cases and death rate, recovery, and death rate.
